Create Amazon ECS Service
Open the create-service.json file:

In AWS Cloud9, navigate to the my-webapp-repo folder and locate the create-service.json file.
Open the file.
Update the create-service.json file:

Replace the targetGroupARN value in line 6 with the appropriate value from the environment outputs (TargetGroup1ARN).
Replace the sample entries for subnets in lines 20 and 21 with the appropriate values (Subnet1 and Subnet2).
Replace the sample security group entry in the securityGroups in line 24 with the appropriate value (SecurityGroupID).
The updated file should look like this:
json
Copy code
{
  "serviceName": "MyApp-Web-service",
  "taskDefinition": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:000000000000:task-definition/my-webapp:1",
  "loadBalancers": [
    {
      "targetGroupArn": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:000000000000:targetgroup/MyApp-ALB-target1/553b1785838b7a0f",
      "containerName": "my-webapp",
      "containerPort": 80
    }
  ],
  "desiredCount": 1,
  "launchType": "FARGATE",
  "networkConfiguration": {
    "awsvpcConfiguration": {
      "subnets": [
        "subnet-0cc4643e574a9c4ad",
        "subnet-0c84b76a63ebdcfa0"
      ],
      "securityGroups": [
        "sg-0b15b19182b9eea0c"
      ],
      "assignPublicIp": "ENABLED"
    }
  }
}
Save the file.

Create the service using AWS CLI:

Open the terminal in AWS Cloud9.
Execute the following command to create the service:
bash
Copy code
aws ecs create-service --service-name MyApp-Web-service --cli-input-json file://create-service.json
You should see output confirming the service creation.
Task 2: Push Changes to Source Repository
Check the status of changes:

Make sure you are in the my-webapp-repo folder:
bash
Copy code
cd my-webapp-repo
Check the Git status:
bash
Copy code
git status
Add changes to Git:

Run the following commands to add changes and push them to the Git repository:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Updated taskdef file"
git push
Task 3: Review Application Status
Check Load Balancer DNS:

Get the LoadBalancerDNSName from the information in the console.
Open the application in a browser:

Open a new tab in your browser and enter the LoadBalancerDNSName to review the page.
Task 4: Configure Blue/Green Deployment
Create a CodeDeploy Application:

Go to AWS CodeDeploy and create a new application named MyApp-Web.
Choose the compute platform as Amazon ECS.
Create a Deployment Group:

Create a new deployment group named MyApp-Web-ECS-Group and select CodeDeploy_Service_Role as the service role.
Configure the Environment:

Choose my-webapp-cluster as the ECS Cluster name.
Choose MyApp-Web-service as the ECS Service name.
Choose MyApp-ALB as the Load Balancer.
Configure Deployment Settings:

Choose Reroute traffic immediately and CodeDeployDefault.ECSAllAtOnce.
Create the Deployment Group.

Task 5: Add Deployment Stage to Pipeline
Add a New Deployment Stage:

Go to my-webapp-pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.
Click Edit, then Add stage, and enter the stage name Deploy.
Add a New Action Group:

Choose Add action group.
Enter my-webapp-deploy as the action name and select Amazon ECS (Blue/Green).
Configure the Options:

Choose MyApp-Web as the CodeDeploy Application and MyApp-Web-ECS-Group as the Deployment Group.
Select SourceArtifact and BuildArtifact for the appropriate inputs.
Save Changes.

Task 6: Test CodePipeline Automation
Change the Application Code:

Open the Dockerfile and change the background color from blue to green.
Save the changes.
Push the changes to the repository using:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Updated Dockerfile file"
git push
Monitor the Deployment Process:

Go to CodePipeline to monitor the progress of the deployment.
Check the deployment details when the status reaches the deployment phase.
Verify Changes in the Application:

Refresh the open tab in your browser to see the changes on the website.
By following these detailed steps, you will be able to create an Amazon ECS servic
